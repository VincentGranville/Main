This repository features material related to content that spreads across multiple folders. For the time being, it is related to my new book <em>Synthetic Data and Generative AI</em>, 
available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/shop/">here</a>, and published by Elsevier.
<p>It also includes: 
<ul>  
<li>NoGAN code, a tabular data synthesizer running 1000x faster than GenAI methods based on neural networks, and consistently delivering better results 
regardless of the evaluation metric (including state-of-the-art new quality metrics capturing a lot more than traditional distances), both on categorical and numerical features, or a mix of both. For details, see technical paper #29, available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/resources/">here</a>. 

<li>DeepResampling code, another fast NoGAN based on resampling and distribution-free Hierarchical Bayesian Models, with hyperparameter auto-tuning.
For details, see technical paper #31, available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/resources/">here</a>. 

<li>NoGAN_Hellinger code (two scripts), with loss function replaced by the Hellinger model evaluation metric. A blend of NoGAN and DeepResampling. For details,
see section 2.4 in the project textbook, <a href="https://github.com/VincentGranville/Large-Language-Models/blob/main/Projects4.pdf">here</a>. </li>  
<ul>
