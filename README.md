This repository features material related to content that spreads across multiple folders. For the time being, it is related to my new book <em>Synthetic Data and Generative AI</em>, 
available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/2022/11/28/new-book-synthetic-data/">here</a>.
<p>It also includes the NoGAN code, a tabular data synthesizer running 1000x faster than GenAI methods based on neural networks, and consistently delivering better results 
regardless of the quality evaluation metric (including state-of-the-art new metrics capturing a lot more than traditional distances), both on categorical and numerical features, or a mix of both.</p>
